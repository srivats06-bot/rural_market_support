# Rural Market Support Platform

A decision-support web platform that helps farmers choose the **most profitable mandi** to sell their crops by moving beyond price display to **net profit–based recommendations**.

---

## Problem Statement

Farmers often rely on middlemen or raw mandi price lists to decide where to sell their produce.  
Existing platforms display prices but do not account for **transportation cost, distance, or profitability**, making it difficult for farmers to make informed decisions.

This results in:
- Lower net income
- Price exploitation
- Decision confusion due to data overload

---

## Solution Overview

The **Rural Market Support Platform** is a rural-first web application that recommends the **best mandi to sell** based on **net profit**, not just price.

Instead of overwhelming farmers with data, the platform:
- Calculates profit after transport cost
- Clearly recommends one mandi
- Explains *why* the recommendation is made
- Shows MSP as a safety benchmark

---

## Key Features

- **Net Profit–Based Mandi Recommendation**
- **Single Clear Recommendation (Decision Support)**
- **Explainable Logic (Why this mandi?)**
- **Transport Cost & Distance Consideration**
- **MSP Awareness**
- **Rural-Friendly, Step-by-Step UI**
- **Clean, Accessible Design**

---

## What Makes This Different

| Existing Platforms | Our Platform |
|-------------------|--------------|
| Show price lists | Recommend best mandi |
| Manual comparison | Automatic profit calculation |
| Data-heavy tables | Simple, guided flow |
| No explanation | Transparent reasoning |
| MSP shown separately | MSP integrated into decision |

> **Most platforms show prices. We tell farmers where to sell and why.**

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
